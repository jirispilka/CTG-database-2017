function out = slidingAvg(in, N, bPlot)
%% function STAN_slidingavg
%The function 'slidingavg' implements a one-dimensional filtering,
%applying a sliding window to a sequence.
%Such filtering replaces the center value in the window with the average 
%value of all the points within the window. 
%When the sliding window is exceeding the lower or upper boundaries 
%of the input vector INPUT_ARRAY, the average is computed among the 
%available points. 
%
%Input parameters:
% - in ..... input signal
% - N ..... scale of the window
% - bPlot.....variable if 1 will enable ploting of the function results
%
%Output parameters:
% - out ..... Filtered input

%                - variable names
%                - complexness of the algorithm
%                - ploting introduced
